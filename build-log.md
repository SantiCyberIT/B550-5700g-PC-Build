## Step 1 – Cleaning Stock Cooler Thermal Paste

### What Happened:
While inspecting the AMD Wraith stock cooler, I accidentally touched the pre-applied thermal paste, which caused it to smear.

Instead of using the damaged stock paste, I removed it and cleaned the cooler base to prepare for Arctic MX-6 thermal compound.

### Process:
- Used isopropyl alcohol and microfiber cloth
- Fully removed all factory thermal paste
- Exposed clean bare metal base

### Status:
✅ Cooler base fully cleaned and ready  
⏳ Next: Applying Arctic MX-6 thermal paste
